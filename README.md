# Mystery Function

What does the `mystery()` function in the following piece of code do? Add your
answer to this markdown file.

```javascript
function mystery(a) {
    if(a.length == 1) return a[0];
    var foo = mystery(a.slice(1, a.length))
    if(foo > a[0]) return foo;
    else return a[0];
}
```

Firstly, the function takes an array of elements as the parameter and checks the array's length. If the array's size is equal to one, the function returns the value at the array index 0. Otherwise, if the array length is more than one then the function declares a variable named foo which is set equal to mystery(a.slice(1, a.length)). what this does is, it recursively calls the same function by slicing the array on each call and setting the first element to be foo. after that, it compares foo with the first element of the newly sliced array. If the value of foo is greater than the value at array[0] it returns foo, else it returns the value at array[0]. This function's main goal is to find the biggest value in the given array.
